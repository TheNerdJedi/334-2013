{"name":"334-2013","tagline":"Competition-ready program for Donatella, an Ultimate Ascent FRC Bot.","body":"Donatella (FRC 2013 Software)\r\n========\r\n\r\n## What is it?\r\n\r\nThis is the competition program for 'Donatella', the 2013 Ultimate Ascent bot built by FRC Team 334 from Brooklyn Technical High School.\r\n\r\nIt is written in [Java ME](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Platform,_Micro_Edition) for the [CompactRIO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CompactRIO) microcontroller. I'm sure you already knew that!\r\n\r\n## Cool! How do I use it?\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n\r\nYou'll need:\r\n\r\n* [The Eclipse IDE](http://eclipse.org/)\r\n* [WPILibJ for Eclipse:](http://first.wpi.edu/FRC/java/eclipse/update/) Add this as a software source and then install the FRC packages.\r\n* Git\r\n\r\n### How-to\r\n\r\n1. Open your favorite shell (this works on Windows too) and do:\r\n```\r\ngit clone git@github.com:mach-kernel/334-2013.git\r\n```\r\n2. Import the project into Eclipse.\r\n3. Fix your build path (this is most likely broken if your eclipse directory is not C:\\eclipse\\ or if you're not using Windows).\r\n4. Set your team number within the FRC preferences\r\n5. ???\r\n6. Profit!\r\n\r\n## This is sweet! Can I use it?\r\n\r\nOf course!
